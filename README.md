# OnlinePinboard
This project was developed as part of my computer science studies at Warsaw University of Technology. It allows user to Login, Register and pin their tasks to a pinboard, and mark whether they completed daily habits or not. Additionally, the project includes a calendar view where users can add new events and they will be displayed on the calendar.

The project was developed using Pycharm runserver
